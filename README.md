- I’m @bovus666
- I’m interested in data science, Python, C++, and applications of those subjects into geology.
- Photogrammetry, spatial data manipulation, cartography/geography, and cooking are also interests of mine.
- BSc in Geology, minor in Computer Science (Spring 2024). I was a chef for ten years before I moved into CS/GS.
